    <h1>MOuse</h1>
    <p>A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.<br> This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display,<br> which allows a smooth control of the graphical user <br>interface of a computer.

        The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was in 1968. Mice originally used two separate wheels to track movement<br> across a surface; one in the X-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design<br> shifted to utilize a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion.<br> Most modern mice<br> use optical sensors that have no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, many modern mice are cordless, <br>relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.
        
        In addition to moving a cursor, computer mice have one or more buttons to allow operations such as the selection of a menu item on a display. Mice often also feature other elements, such as touch surfaces and scroll wheels, which<br> enable additional control and dimensional input.</p>

    <h1>Printer</h1>
    <p>The first computer printer designed was a mechanically driven apparatus by Charles Babbage for his difference engine in the 19th century;<br> however, his mechanical printer design was not built until 2000.[4]

        The first patented printing mechanism for applying a marking medium to a recording medium, or more particularly an electrostatic inking <br>apparatus and a method for electrostatically depositing ink on controlled areas of a receiving medium, was in 1962 by C. R. Winston, Teletype Corporation, using continuous inkjet printing.<br> The ink was a red stamp-pad ink manufactured by Phillips Process Company of Rochester, NY under the name Clear Print.<br> This patent (US3060429) led to the Teletype Inktronic Printer product delivered to <br>customers in late 1966.[5]
        
        The first compact, lightweight digital printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968, according to Epson.
        
        The first commercial printers generally used mechanisms from electric typewriters and Teletype machines. The demand for higher speed led to the <br> development of new systems specifically for computer use. In the 1980s there were daisy wheel <br>systems similar to typewriters, line printers that produced similar output but at much <br>higher speed, and dot-matrix systems that could mix text and graphics but produced relatively low-quality output.<br> The plotter was used for those requiring high-quality line art like blueprints.
        
        The introduction of the low-cost laser printer in 1984, with the first HP LaserJet,[9] and the addition of PostScript in next year's Apple LaserWriter<br> set off a revolution in printing known as desktop publishing.[10] Laser printers using<br> PostScript mixed text and graphics, like dot-matrix printers, but at quality levels formerly <br>available only from commercial typesetting systems. By 1990, most simple printing tasks like fliers and brochures <br> were now created on personal computers and then laser printed; expensive offset <br>printing systems were being dumped as scrap. The HP Deskjet of 1988 offered the same advantages as a laser<br> printer in terms of flexibility, but produced somewhat lower-quality output<br> (depending on the paper) from much less-expensive mechanisms. Inkjet systems rapidly displaced dot-matrix and daisy-wheel printers from the market. By the 2000s,<br> high-quality printers of this sort had fallen under the $100 price point and became commonplace.
        
        The rapid improvement of internet email through the 1990s and into the 2000s has largely displaced the need for printing as a means of moving documents,<br> and a wide variety of reliable storage systems means that a "physical backup" is of little benefit today.
        
        Starting around 2010, 3D printing became an area of intense interest, allowing the creation of physical objects with the same sort of effort as an early<br> laser printer required to produce a brochure. These devices are in their earliest stages<br> of development and have not yet become commonplace.</p>

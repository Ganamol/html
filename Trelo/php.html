    <h1>PHP</h1>
    <P>PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language that helps people make web pages more interactive by <br>allowing them to do more intelligent, complex things. PHP code is run on the web server.

        A website programmed with PHP can have pages that are password protected. A website with no programming cannot do <br>this without other complex things. Standard PHP file extensions are: .php .php3 or .phtml, but a web server<br> can be set up to use any extension.[4][5]
        
        Its structure was influenced by many languages like C, Perl, Java, C++, and even Python. It is considered to be free <br>software by the Free Software Foundation.[6]</P>

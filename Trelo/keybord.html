    <h1>Keybord</h1>
    <p>The keyboard is the most commonly used computer input device. It translates each key pressed by the typist into a signal that the computer can understand.<br> Keyboards can be wireless or connected to the computer by a cable.

    </p>
    <h5>How it works</h5>
    <p>A keyboard consists of two parts: a set of keys that are pushed in sequence by the typist (or keyer) and<br> an encoder that identifies each pressed key and <br>generates a code that uniquely identifies that key. The key set includes <br>the standard alphanumeric keys found on <br>old typewriters and additional keys, such as cursor keys, navigation and function keys, Apple or Windows keys, <br>and a numeric keypad. Keyboards for laptop computers have the minimum number of keys.</p>
    <p>The encoder is a microprocessor located in the keyboard that detects each key as it is pressed and released.<br> To do so, the encoder maintains a set of signals<br> in a grid of intersecting rows and columns. When the typist presses a key, a connection is made on the grid. If, <br>for example, the connection is in the first row and the third column, the encoder immediately identifies the pressed<br> key and sends a special signal, called a "scanning code," to the computer. The computer translates<br> the scanning code into the appropriate binary code and displays the character on the monitor so that the typist can <br>verify that the correct key was pushed.

        The lights on the keyboard (for Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock, and so on) are controlled by the computer, <br>not the keyboard. For example, when the typist presses <br>the Caps Lock key, the keyboard encoder sends the code for the Caps Lock key to the computer, and the computer<br> turns on the keyboard's Caps Lock light.

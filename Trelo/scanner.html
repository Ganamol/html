    <h1>Scanner</h1>
    <p>An image scanner—often abbreviated to just scanner—is a device that optically scans images, printed text, handwriting or an object and converts it to a digital image. <br>Commonly used in offices are variations of the desktop flatbed scanner where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. Hand-held scanners, where the device is moved by hand, have evolved from text scanning <br>"wands" to 3D scanners used for industrial design, reverse engineering, test and measurement, orthotics, gaming and other applications.<br> Mechanically driven scanners that move the document are typically used for large-format documents,<br> where a flatbed design would be impractical.

        Modern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used <br>for the highest possible image quality, use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. A rotary scanner, used for high-speed document scanning, is a type of drum scanner that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier<br>. Non-contact planetary scanners essentially photograph delicate books and documents. All these scanners produce two-dimensional <br>images of subjects that are usually flat, but sometimes solid; 3D scanners produce information on <br>the three-dimensional structure of solid objects.
        
        Digital cameras can be used for the same purposes as dedicated scanners. When compared to a true scanner, a camera image is subject to a degree of distortion, reflections,<br> shadows, low contrast, and blur due to camera shake (reduced in cameras with image stabilization). Resolution is sufficient for less demanding applications. Digital cameras offer advantages of speed, portability and non-contact <br>digitizing of thick documents without damaging the book spine. In 2010 scanning technologies were combining 3D scanners with <br>digital cameras to create full-color, photo-realistic 3D models of objects.[1]
        
        In the biomedical research area, detection devices for DNA microarrays are called scanners as well. These scanners are high-resolution systems (up to 1 µm/ pixel), similar to<br> microscopes. The detection is done via CCD or a photomultiplier tubes.</p>

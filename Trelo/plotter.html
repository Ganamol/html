    <h1>Plotter</h1>
    <p>
        A plotter is a machine that produces vector graphics drawings. Plotters draw lines on paper using a pen,<br> or in some applications, use a knife to cut a material like vinyl or leather. In the latter case, they are sometimes <br> known as a cutting plotter.

In the past, plotters were used in applications such as computer-aided design, as they were able to produce line <br>drawings much faster and of a higher quality than contemporary conventional printers. Smaller desktop plotters were  <br>often used for business graphics. Printers with graphics capabilities took away <br> some of the market by the early 1980s, and the introduction of laser printers in the mid-1980s largely eliminated  <br>the use of plotters from most roles.

Plotters retained a niche for producing very large drawings for many years, but have now largely been replaced by <br>wide-format conventional printers. Cutting plotters remain in use in a number of industries.
    </p>
    <p>Digitally controlled plotters evolved from earlier fully analog XY-writers used as output devices for measurement <br>instruments and analog computers.

        Pen plotters print by moving a pen or other instrument across the surface of a piece of paper. This means that plotters <br> are vector graphics devices, rather than raster graphics as with other printers. Pen plotters can draw <br> complex line art, including text, but do so slowly because of the mechanical  <br>movement of the pens. They are often incapable of efficiently creating a solid region of color, but can hatch an area <br> by drawing a number of close, regular lines.
        
        Plotters offered the fastest way to efficiently produce very large drawings or color high-resolution vector-based artwork  <br>when computer memory was very expensive and processor power was very limited, and other types of printers <br> had limited graphic output capabilities.
        
        Pen plotters have essentially become obsolete, and have been replaced by large-format inkjet printers and LED toner-based  <br>printers. Such devices may still understand vector languages originally designed for plotter use, because in <br> many uses, they offer a more efficient alternative to raster data.</p>

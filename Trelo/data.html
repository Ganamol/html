    <h1>Data Science</h1>
    <p>Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract <br>knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data,[1][2] and apply knowledge<br> and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related <br>to data mining, machine learning and big data.

        Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to <br>"understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many <br>fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and <br>domain knowledge.[4] However, data science is different from computer science and information<br> science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything<br> about science is changing because of the impact of information technology"<br> and the data deluge</p>

   <h1>Flutter</h1> 
   <p>The first version of Flutter was known as "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit[6] with the stated <br>intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second.[7] During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai in September<br> 2018, Google announced Flutter Release Preview 2, the last major release before Flutter 1.0.<br> On December 4th of that year, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the first<br> stable version of the framework. On December 11, 2019, Flutter 1.12 was released at the Flutter<br> Interactive event.[8]

    On May 6, 2020, the Dart software development kit (SDK) version 2.8 and Flutter 1.17.0 were released, adding support for the Metal API which improves performance on<br> iOS devices by approximately 50%, as well as new Material widgets and network tracking development tools.
    
    On March 3, 2021, Google released Flutter 2 during an online Flutter Engage event. This major update brought official support for web-based applications with a new CanvasKit<br> renderer and web specific widgets, early-access desktop application support for Windows, macOS, and Linux and improved Add-to-App APIs.<br>[9] This release also utilized Dart 2.0 that featured sound null-safety, which caused <br>many breaking changes and issues with many external packages; however, the Flutter team included instructions <br>and tools to mitigate these issues.[10]
    
    On September 8th, 2021, Dart 2.14 and Flutter 2.5 were released by Google. The update brought improvements to the Android full-screen mode and the latest version of Google's<br> Material Design called Material You.
